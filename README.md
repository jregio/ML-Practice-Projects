Just some projects to help me practice machine learning

**Iris Classification (3/24)**

The Iris dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository.  Features of the plant were used to classify the species.  
Logistic regression was implemented along with regularization.  Validation set was used to tune regularization hyperparameter.  
Model achieves around 92% - 100% test accuracy.  Large variation in test accuracy is due to the small size of the dataset (m = 150).

Features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Classes:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolour
- Iris virginica
